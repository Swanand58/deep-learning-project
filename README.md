# Portfolio Construction with a Model-Free Approach

## Overview

This project explores a deep learning-based end-to-end approach for portfolio construction, addressing the limitations of the traditional two-stage process. By directly learning portfolio weights from historical returns, it mitigates error accumulation and enhances adaptability. The code validates the mathematical formulations described in the accompanying report and demonstrates the practical implementation of this approach.

## Contents

1. **Code**: The Jupyter Notebook implements the neural network for portfolio optimization, including forward and backpropagation steps. It validates the mathematical derivations and demonstrates portfolio weight computations for synthetic and real datasets.
2. **Report**: Provides the theoretical background, including the limitations of traditional methods, the proposed model-free approach, and performance analysis.

## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`PortfolioConstructionEndToEndModelFreeApproachToyCode.ipynb`) to explore and validate the concepts through Python implementation.

Feel free to experiment with the code and datasets to deepen your understanding of this innovative approach to portfolio construction.
